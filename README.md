# FINAL-FANTASY-BATTLE-SYSTEM

## What is this?
This is a little battle system created for the purpose of practicing logic when creating an old school RPG system. I will be starting small and creating basic 1 versus 1 combat where there is a winner and a loser, but then spanding upon this with fully fleshed out character systems, buffs, debuffs, items, and more. I can fully use this logic to create an actual RPG in a game engine like Unity or Unreal Engine. You can also use this logic if you'd like!
